## Description
A Minecraft mod that allows [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap) to render .obj models and adds a framework for supporting other modded formats as well (as long as they use the "loader" property).

- Requires Fabric, Forge or NeoForge
- Requires BlueMap 5.7

## Planned features
- Change mod to a native BlueMap addon
- Add other model formats natively supported by Minecraft mod loaders (such as "neoforge:composite")
